My ultimate research objective is to integrate theoretical analysis along with practical design patterns to build secure and resilient networks and systems.\nI have a passion for learning, teaching, and the overall exchange of knowledge. I have taught ECE 541: Computer System Analysis and have been a Teaching Assistant for the Operating Systems course at UIUC. I am a big fan of teaching Linux kernel programming and learning new things about the kernel.\nOutside of the computer world, I am an amateur student of philosophy. My favorite philosophers are Søren Kierkegaard and Slavoj Žižek.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":1595304392,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I will be joining the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology as an assistant professor starting Fall 2020.\nI am a P.h.D. candidate at the Computer Science Department at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, advised by Professor William H.
